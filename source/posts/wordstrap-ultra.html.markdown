This is a simple wordpress theme where every commonly used wordpress feature has been tweaked to use bootstrap.

I started with the barebones starkers theme, I added the bootstrap css and javascript libraries, then I went through every part of the theme applying bootstrap styles where appropriate. What this means is that although you can use this theme as it is, it is also a perfect framework to start building your own theme on top of. This is all due to the flexibility of bootstrap as a css framework. Included in this theme is all the bootstrap css and javascript (even though it is not all used) and the google code prettify libraries. It also uses Modernizr which means any html5 code you require will work in older browsers. As the theme is offered for free, it’s also offered without support.

__Please note:__ this was built on bootstrap 2. Bootstrap 3 is now out and has many more useful features. I currently have no plans to update this to bootstrap 3
