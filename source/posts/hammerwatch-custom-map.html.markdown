Tricks and traps is a custom campaign built for the fantastic indie co-op dungeon crawler Hammerwatch. This campaign is inspired by the Doom II level of the same name.

## Installation instructions

1.  [Get Hammerwatch][7]</a>
2.  Download "tricks and traps" custom campaign [from me][1] or subscribe to it on the [steam workshop][2]
3.  Unzip this file inside your hammerwatch/levels folder
4.  launch a custom game using the tricks and traps campaign

## About

*   This campaign is supposed to be hard and is ideally completed with one or two players.
*   Ranger is easy mode (as in the vanilla game).
*   There is an optimal path through the level where difficulty ramps up slowly and the upgrades you find allow you to take on the harder rooms.
*   However it is also possible to complete it very quickly once you know where the right keys are.
*   When you finish the campaign it will tell you how many secrets you have found of which there are 7 in total and the aim really is to find them all.

Here's a playthrough which contains spoilers by a Spanish gaming channel on youtube:

## What is Hammerwatch?

Hammerwatch is a great indie game by Jochum Skoglund and Niklas Myrberg which also comes with a really simple level editor for creating custom content. The game is similar to classic dungeon crawlers like [Gauntlet][3] or the more modern [Magicka][4].

## Why recreate a Doom level?

When playing through the game I was struck by how much it shares with the Doom games. Despite the obvious differences (most notably of course Doom is a first person perspective game while Hammerwatch is a top down game) they have a lot in common thematically:

*   Overwhelming hordes of enemies
*   Fast paced combat where your character's speed is your best defense
*   Lots of secrets to discover and puzzles to solve
*   Hidden walls
*   Teleports

When I started playing with the Hammerwatch level editor I realised that while it is very easy to build a simple campaign, What I wanted to do was going to be a bit more complicated given the complexity of the Tricks and Traps level with all the moving walls, hidden secrets and teleports. Here is a video of somebody speedrunning through the level to give you some idea:
